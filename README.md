# share_calculator_app
This app will calculate the number of shares you need to buy or sell to rebalance a portfolio. 

All you need to do is input the portfolio equity, the stock symbols, the portfolio weights, and the number of shares held (if any). After that the app will output the net shares needed to buy or sell to reach your target weights. 

It queries the stock prices using the alpaca api.
